/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/
 * 
 * Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is
 * a palindrome.
 * 
 * The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two
 * integers.
 * 
 * Example 1: Input: "123" Output: "121" Note: The input n is a positive integer
 * represented by string, whose length will not exceed 18. If there is a tie,
 * return the smaller one as answer.
