/**
 * Memory optimization II
 * 
 * Give a computer with total K memory space, and an array of foreground tasks
 * and background tasks the computer needs to do. Write an algorithm to find a
 * pair of tasks from each array to maximize the memory usage. Notice the tasks
 * could be done without origin order.
 * 
 * Input The input to the function/method consists of three arguments :
 * foregroundTask, an array representing the memory usage of the foreground
 * tasks, backgroundTask, an array representing the memory usage of the
 * background tasks, K, the total memory space of the computer.
 * 
 * Output Return a list of pairs of the task ids.
 * 
 * Examples 1 
 * Input: 
 * foregroundTasks = [1, 7, 2, 4, 5, 6] 
 * backgroundTasks = [3, 1, 2] 
 * K = 6
 * 
 * Output: [(3, 2), (4, 1), (5,-1)]
