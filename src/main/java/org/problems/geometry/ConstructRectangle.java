/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/
 * 
 * For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's
 * size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to
 * design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the
 * following requirements:
 * 
 * 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given
 * target area.
 * 
 * 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
 * 
 * 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as
 * possible. You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you
 * designed in sequence.
 * 
 * Example: Input: 4 Output: [2, 2] Explanation: The target area is 4, and all
 * the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. But according to
 * requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3, [4,1] is not
 * optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
 * 
 * Note: The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer The
 * web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.
 *
